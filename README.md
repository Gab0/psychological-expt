## About

In this project, we implement well-known psychological experiments using `phaser.js`.
The experiments include the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) and the Trail Making Test (TMT).
A table describing all available psychological experiments in this repository, along with their current development stages, can be found  [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tnqecerGzQ1GFEjt70_OAQvnZnjJVB4ZK5GHkP42_Mw).

We also develop a simple library containing functionalities that are commonly required by psychological experiments. It includes `javascript` methods and `SQL` code. This library helps to store experiment results in a `Supabase` instance.

The system is currently hosted here: https://psy.nutshellbiotech.com/
